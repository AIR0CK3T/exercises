# Linux - README

This folder contains several Linux specific exercises and tasks to get familiar
with IoT standard technologies and protocols. Many of them will also involve or
require embedded IoT hardware, i.e., (sensor) nodes that run RIOT-OS.

The exercises are grouped into folders each covering a certain topic. Not all
tasks start from scratch, thus they may rely on or reference other tasks.
